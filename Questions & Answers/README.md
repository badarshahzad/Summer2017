What is Boiler Plate and Boiler Palte Action?

"Boilerplate" has nothing to do with performance: it just means standard code that is required to define an application or work with some framework. It's code that is likely to be identical in every application.

A "hot spot", on the other hand, means a part of the code that is executed many times and therefore its performance matters a lot to the overall application performance. Usually a hot spot is identified by actual profiling: it's not a hot spot if it's executed many times but is so trivial that its impact on performance is minimal.

In computer programming, boilerplate code or boilerplate refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. It is often used when referring to languages that are considered verbose, i.e. the programmer must write a lot of code to do minimal jobs.

What is Java Bean and purpose?
In computing based on the Java Platform, JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). They are serializable, have a zero-argument constructor, and allow access to properties using getter and setter methods.

What is Aspect-Oriented Programming?
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is an approach to programming that allows global properties of a program to determine how it is compiled into an executable program. AOP can be used with object-oriented programming ( OOP ). An aspect is a subprogram that is associated with a specific property of a program.

what is santatic sugar?
In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

what is Maven and gradle project what is the difference between them?

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. The word maven means "accumulator of knowledge" in Yiddish. Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built, and second, it describes its 
dependencies.

You can think of Gradle as goodness of Ant and Maven put together minus the noise of XML. And scriptability with groovy is very big plus.

Gradle gives you conventions but still gives you power to override them easily.
Gradle build files are less verbose as they are written in groovy.
It provides very nice DSL for writing build tasks.
Has lot of good plugins and vibrant ecosystem
When to use Gradle and When to use Maven ?
Almost everywhere for creating java/groovy project. The build files are much terse.

With Google choosing Gradle as the new build system for Android SDK and mature libraries like Spring, Hibernate, Grails, Groovy etc. already using it to power their builds, there is no doubt that Gradle is becoming de-facto build system for the Java ecosystem.

What is Maven and Ant?
Difference between Ant and Maven. Ant and Maven both are build tools provided by Apache. The main purpose of these technologies is to ease the build process of a project. Ant doesn't has formal conventions, so we need to provide information of the project structure in build.xml file.

What is the Java war vs. jar - what is the difference?What is the difference between a .jar and a .war file? Is it only the file extension or is there something more?
These files are simply zipped files using the java jar tool. These files are created for different purposes. Here is the description of these files:

.jar files: The .jar files contain libraries, resources and accessories files like property files.
.war files: The war file contains the web application that can be deployed on any servlet/jsp container. The .war file contains jsp, html, javascript and other files necessary for the development of web applications

In software engineering, a WAR file (or Web application ARchive[1]) is a JAR file used to distribute a collection of JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, static web pages (HTML and related files) and other resources that together constitute a web application.

resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.[3]

JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file. They are built on the ZIP format and typically have a .jar file extension.[4]
